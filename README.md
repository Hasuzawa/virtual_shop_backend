# virtual_shop_backend
This is the backend of a virtual shop project. There is <b>no</b> actual transaction involving real money.

I have created an account with read-only permission that can be used to view the admin page.
| username | password |
|----------|----------|
|test_client|(not set yet)|

you can access the admin page by [this link]().
I made only minimal changes to the admin page, that is not the focus of this project.

## technical commentaries
<details close>

-  for database with more complex relationships, I will probably use UML in designing the DB.
-  I am aware that publishing the backend with login credentials is a severe security risk. I certainly will not do this in actual proudction enironment.
